## Purpose

The Multi-Model SDK orchestrates multiple AI models across the internal workforce. Routes inference requests to the right model, manages provider hierarchies, handles fallback chains, and provides a unified interface regardless of which model powers the response.

## Modules

| Module | Export Path | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Model Orchestrator | `./model-orchestrator` | Coordinates multiple models for complex tasks |
| Provider Router | `./provider-router` | Routes to correct model provider based on task type |
| Inference Unifier | `./inference-unifier` | Normalizes output across different model formats |
| Fallback Chain | `./fallback-chain` | Cascading fallback when primary model fails |
| Model Registry | `./model-registry` | Internal catalog of available models and capabilities |
| Context Manager | `./context-manager` | Manages conversation context across model switches |

## Architecture

```
Task Request ──→ [Model Registry] ──→ Available models
                       │
                [Provider Router] ──→ Best model for task
                       │
              [Model Orchestrator] ──→ Multi-model coordination
                       │
              [Inference Unifier] ──→ Normalized response
                       │
               [Context Manager] ──→ State preserved
                       │
               [Fallback Chain] ──→ If failure, try next
```

## Model Hierarchy (Internal Workforce)

```
Tier 1 — Sovereign Models (on-chain, self-hosted)
Tier 2 — Partner Models (API-based, controlled)
Tier 3 — Utility Models (commodity, replaceable)
```

All models are treated as internal infrastructure — not products, not services, just tools for the AI workforce.

## Pre-Booted

The Model Registry loads at instantiation. The Provider Router is ready to route from heartbeat one.

## Quick Usage

```js
import { createDefaultMultiModelStack } from '@medina/multi-model-sdk';

const orchestrator = createDefaultMultiModelStack();

const result = orchestrator.infer(
  {
    workflowId: 'career-upskill-flow',
    contextId: 'employee-8472',
    taskType: 'workflow',
    lane: 'interior',        // interior | exterior
    securityLevel: 'hardened',
    payload: { goal: 'transition-to-ai-ops' },
  },
  [
    ({ route, payload }) => ({ success: true, modelId: route.modelId, output: payload.goal }),
  ],
);
```

## Security + Lane Model

- `interior` lane: internal workforce and sovereign model execution
- `exterior` lane: partner/customer facing execution surfaces
- `securityLevel`: `standard` | `hardened` | `critical`
