# Release checklist for Google Play

Work through this top to bottom. Anything marked **once** only has to happen the first time.

## 1. Accounts (once)

- [ ] Google Play Console developer account (one-time registration fee, identity verification can take days).
- [ ] RevenueCat project with a Google Play app. Copy the **public SDK key** (`goog_...`).
- [ ] In Play Console, create the app, package name `com.sovereignengine.books`.
- [ ] Link RevenueCat to Play: upload the Play service account JSON under RevenueCat > Project > Apps > Google Play.

## 2. Products (once)

- [ ] In Play Console > Monetize > Subscriptions, create `sovereign_pro_monthly` and `sovereign_pro_annual` with base plans and a free trial offer.
- [ ] In RevenueCat, import the products, create entitlement `pro_access`, and an offering `default` containing both packages.
- [ ] Optional: design a Paywall in RevenueCat > Paywalls. The app shows it through `PaywallDialog`; without one the Pro screen lists packages directly.
- [ ] Configure Customer Center in RevenueCat so "Manage subscription" works.

## 3. Build configuration

- [ ] Copy `android-app/local.properties.example` to `android-app/local.properties`.
- [ ] Set `REVENUECAT_GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `REVENUECAT_ENTITLEMENT_ID`, and the production `BOOKS_API_BASE_URL` (must be HTTPS).
- [ ] Create an upload keystore (once) and set `KEYSTORE_PATH`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`:
  ```bash
  keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -alias upload -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
  ```
- [ ] Bump `VERSION_CODE` (must increase on every upload) and `VERSION_NAME`.

## 4. Build

```bash
cd android-app
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease
# -> app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

For a quick device check:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## 5. Play Console

- [ ] App content: privacy policy URL, ads declaration (no ads), data safety (see `data-safety.md`), content rating questionnaire, target audience (18+ business tool), government app (no), financial features (declare "budgeting and expense tracking"; no loans or payments issued by the app).
- [ ] Store listing: copy from `store-listing.md`, 512 px icon, feature graphic, screenshots.
- [ ] Upload the AAB to **Internal testing** first. Install from the testing link and run through a purchase with a license tester account.
- [ ] New developer accounts must run a closed test with at least 12 testers for 14 days before production access is granted. Start this early.
- [ ] Promote to production and submit for review.

## 6. After release

- [ ] Verify a real purchase shows up in RevenueCat and that `pro_access` unlocks the Credits tab.
- [ ] Set the RevenueCat webhook to `https://<your api>/api/v1/books/revenuecat/webhook` with `REVENUECAT_WEBHOOK_AUTH` as the Authorization value so the server mirrors entitlements.
- [ ] Tag the commit: `git tag android-v1.0.0`.
